# The-True-Story-of-Red-Riding-Hood
Making a choice-based game about little red riding hood in Python (This is my first game ever)


This game is very simple and does not have a lot of depth to it, it is just a simple and fun project so that I can learn how to properly learn how to code
and have good project structure.

All the files needed should be available.

To compile and run the file as an executable, you can use auto-py-to-exe or any other tool you like.

Have fun helping or just checking in to see how the project goes! :)
